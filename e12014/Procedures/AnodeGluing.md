# Questions to answer
-> 1. Vacuum table, Pump. (Works well, 2020/02/07)
2. Frame can hold the vacuum table and rise-fall. ( Seam told me it finished, but maybe have some problem. )
-> 3. When vacuum table hold the anode board, how to make sure the anode board can get through the dowel pin( The vacuum table is small enough, so the hole for the dowel pin can be seen directly, 2020/02/07)
4. 1mm spacer is enough for the 200Mohm resister and read out cable. ( we need solder the cable and resister on the prototype, then check. )
5. Enough conductive epoxy, and the conductivity. ( Need to check with detector lab  )
6. Small weight need to be added on the cable to make the cable straight. Does the vacuum table can hold this extra weight. ( practice with vacuum table, here maybe need a little discussion )
7. Proper quantity of epoxy, when the transparent board arrived, we can practice.
