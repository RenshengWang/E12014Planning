# GHS Procedures

## System specifications
* Always maintain a positive pressure in the ion chmaber (IC)
* Control pumping speed using one valve
* Control venting speed using one valve
* GHS should use absolute pressure monometer during run
* GHS should use differential pressure gauge during venting/pumping
* We should always be at vacuum when the TPC is

## Pumping

## Venting


# Vacuum procedures from last time

## Pumping
*	Turn off the HV of Si, IC and MCP, but not the HPGe. Turn off the power of IC preamp (+-6V)
*	Close vent valve V4 and V5, open by pass V6
*	Open G207VV, close G204GV with computer
*	Close pump valve V1
*	Vent the pump tube
*	Open the valves near turbos V2, V3
*	Open the valve of P10 pump V7
*	Open pump valve V1 slowly
*	Regulate IC with GHS ~50, only open and connect “Vacuum, V13, V12, DET, V15” in GHS
*	~500mTorr, turn on turbos T1, T2
*	When turbo ready, turn on ion gauges IG1 and IG2
*	Close G207VV, open G204GV
*	Close by pass V6
*	Connect P10 gas but not open
*	pump the air in the p10 gas tube (open V14)
*	open P10 GAS

## Venting
*	Turn off the HV of Si, IC and MCP, but not the HPGe. Turn off the power of IC preamp (+-6V)
*	Open G207VV, close G204GV
*	open by pass V6
*	turn off ion gauges IG1 and IG2
*	turn off turbos T1, T2
*	close the valves near turbos V2, V3
*	close P10 gas
*	Empty P10 gas from IC and GHS, open V11 and V14 with GHS
*	Regulate IC with GHS ~50. Only open and connect “gas, control valve, V15, det, V10”
*	Open vent valve V4 slowly

## Always be careful: 
*	The HV of Si, IC, MCP and HPGe
*	P10 gas
*	The foil between two chamber
*	The IC pressure should be positive
